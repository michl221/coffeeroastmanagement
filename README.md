# How to try it

The easiest way to try the program is to use the [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mb221/coffeeroastmanagement) provided on [docker.com](docker.com).

Copy the following contents in a file called `Dockerfile` and execute `docker-compose up`.
The coffee roast management application is available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). It should also be available at a non-loopback IP address.

```Dockerfile
version: '3'

services:
  server:
    image: mb221/coffeeroastmanagement:0.1.0
    depends_on:
      - postgres

# Warning

This software is meant to run in a private network. There are no encrypted connections, there is no authentication and no authorization. Simply speaking, there is no security concept.

So, when you run the software ensure that it is not accessible from public networks.

# Development

In case you are intereseted, the program is written in C# .NET 5 Blazor (Webassembly) using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019. All data is stored in a PostreSQL database.

# Why?

I wanted to start home roasting and thought about storing green bean information, e.g., bean details, where did I buy it, how much did I buy, etc. And I wanted to store roast logs / profiles in a structured way, so I am able to query it and analyze the data.

I did not find a freely available program, which served this purpose. Therefore, I started to write one myself.
